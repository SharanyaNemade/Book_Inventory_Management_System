**Book Inventory Management System using React**


**Overview**

The Book Inventory Management System is a web application built using React that allows
users to manage a collection of books. The application provides a user-friendly interface for
performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the inventory of books. It
fetches book data dynamically from an API and displays it on the landing page. Users can view
details of specific books by clicking on them.



**Features**

1. Landing Page/Home Page: The landing page serves as the home page of the application
and displays a list of all the books available in the inventory. Users can see a summary of
each book's information, such as its title and author. CRUD operations are accessible
from this page.

2. API Integration: The application fetches book data dynamically using an API. This
ensures that the inventory remains up-to-date and reflects the latest changes to the
collection of books.

3. Book Details Page: Clicking on a specific book on the landing page redirects the user to a
new page that displays detailed information about that book. The information includes
the author's name, published date, publisher, and an overview of the book's content.

4. Responsive and Interactive Design: The entire web application is designed to be
responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. It provides an
interactive and user-friendly experience, making it easy for users to navigate and
perform actions.
